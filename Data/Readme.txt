Memo_Dataset.csv is the file to be used for fine-tuning and other experiments.
Note: it has more Trigger than Non-Trigger, so you can randomly pick a balanced amount of each. 

df_benefits_Non_Trigger.csv might be also useful: it contains questions from AHD that were asking about benefits of random things (e.g. some fruit.. or medications of course; but overall considered non-Trigger)
